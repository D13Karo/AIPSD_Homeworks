During this homework, I learned a lot about working with audio in Python. My main goal was to take a recorded audio file and convert it into a text transcript. At first, I had some trouble because my audio was in .m4a format, which I hadn’t worked with before. I also ran into problems when trying to transcribe long audio files, because the script would freeze or not give any output.

I solved this by using the pydub library to split the audio into smaller chunks and convert it to WAV format in memory. Then I used the speech_recognition library with Google’s API to transcribe each chunk. I learned that breaking audio into chunks makes transcription much more reliable and avoids errors. I also added logging to track which chunks were processed successfully and which failed, so I could check the progress easily.

After getting the transcription, I experimented with generating an audio summary using gTTS. This worked well for short summaries, although it required an internet connection and sometimes gave minor errors if the text was long. Overall, I learned how to handle audio files, work with cloud APIs, and use Python for real-world tasks like transcription and text-to-speech.
